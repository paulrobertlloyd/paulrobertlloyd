# User manual

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Paul, an independent designer, writer and occasional speaker based in Brighton, England. I work with public sector organisations to help them design and deliver brilliant digital services.

This is my user manual, a quick way to know a little about me and how I like to work.

This is a living document that was last updated on 4 September 2023.

## Working hours

I work a 4-day week (Monday to Thursday) between the hours of 10am and 6pm.

Iâ€™m an evening person.

I donâ€™t mind being contacted at any time but will likely only respond during working hours.

Feel free to add meetings to my calendar if Iâ€™m free. I may block out several hours during the day if I need time to concentrate on a particular task.

## Work environment

I work best in environments with low-levels of background noise.

I donâ€™t listen to music or podcasts when working, and similarly find it hard to be in offices where loud conversations take place. I cannot work in deathly silence, either. A quiet coffee shop or co-working space tends to be my sweet-spot.

I like work spaces to be clean, tidy and organised.

Plants make a world of difference.

## Communication

The best way to reach me is using the teamâ€™s chosen group messaging application (for example, Slack or Teams). I have notifications turned off so may not respond immediately.

I donâ€™t like speaking on the phone, and can be quite curt when doing so.

I manage my email inbox so that it only contains messages requiring action. I tend to respond within a few days, unless a response is needed sooner.

I may speak in meetings with a lot of confidence and assuredness but this doesnâ€™t mean Iâ€™m wedded to what Iâ€™m saying! Consider it more an invitation to be challenged. Strong opinions, loosely held.

## Collaboration

I love collaborating around a design problem, but will need time on my own to reflect, too.

I tend to be a structured, visual thinker and like to work in collaborative documents and whiteboards.

I feel better able to contribute when people involved in a meeting are sharing the same space, be that a remote call or meeting room.

I learn by doing. This means I will sometimes rush into designing a solution. Since Iâ€™m no longer working in the abstract, this helps me understand a problem and pull it apart.

## Providing feedback

I appreciate openness and honesty. Iâ€™d rather have difficult conversations than leave things unsaid or engage in inauthentic communication.

All feedback is a learning opportunity. If your feedback can include examples and suggestions on how I could improve, all the better.

## Things I value

I value authenticity, and find it hard to be around bullshit or needless exaggeration. I also appreciate consistency, be this in terms of design, communication or behaviour.

I desire honesty and openness. Iâ€™ll happily share my appalling taste in music or embarrassing stories. This is also why I like to document my work and design in the open, and no doubt why Iâ€™ve decided to write this user manual!

## Things I struggle with

I can be meticulous and detail orientated. This can lead me to taking on additional work and spending extra time to ensure a product meets my own self-imposed quality measures.

That said, over the course of my career, Iâ€™ve come to appreciate pragmatism, iteration and getting feedback from users at the earliest opportunity (as this improves quality).

Sometimes I can end up juggling too many disparate tasks which then overwhelm me. This often happens when writing code, spotting unrelated bugs, and wanting to fix them all straight away. Iâ€™m getting better at finding ways to manage this.

I can be contrarian. I donâ€™t consider popularity to be a measure of quality. New tools or technology, early in their hype cycle, rarely interest or excite me and I will dismiss them outright. Iâ€™m a late adopter by design.

Relatedly, I distrust and dislike large corporations, especially those emanating from Silicon Valley, and avoid using company names as verbs (for example, Iâ€™ll write â€˜web searchâ€™ not â€˜Googleâ€™). Probably the result of [latent trauma](https://paulrobertlloyd.com/2015/341/a1/peaceful_reflection/).

My principles sometimes get the better of me.

## Other things to know about me

* Currently learning to speak Portuguese, albeit slowly.
* I avoid flying for ecological reasons, but enjoy travelling around Europe by train and then [writing about my adventures](https://paulrobertlloyd.com/categories/travel/).
* Have several side projects on the go. I may spend my spare time iterating the design of [my website](https://paulrobertlloyd.com), developing [Indiekit](https://getindiekit.com) or adding content to [Bradshawâ€™s Guide](https://beta.bradshaws.guide).
* I closely follow Formula 1, although unsure why.
* My favourite quote is the first sentence from [The Go-Between](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Go-Between), by L. P. Hartley:

    > The past is a foreign country; they do things differently there.

* One day Iâ€™ll get a dog.

I was inspired to write my user manual after hearing [Vimla Appadoo talk about company cultures](https://2023.uxlondon.com/speakers/vimla-appadoo/), and having values and working practices radiate from team members rather than be imposed top down.
